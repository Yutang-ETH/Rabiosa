Here is how I generated the linkage map for scaffolding to generate Rabiosa v1.

Simple, map preprocessed GBS data to contigs generated by Flye, then call SNPs, do imputation, build the linkage map, and finally anchor contigs to linkage groups.

Please download the pdf files and check the shell script to see the details.
