This folder contains codes used for genome annotation and synteny analysis

Steps for genome annotation and repeat annotation are described in annotation.pdf. Please download the file to see more.

make_circos_plot_23082024.R is the R script to generate the circos plot
mydot_new.R is the R plot to make the dot plot of the genome synteny

To detect collinear blocks, mcscanx python version was used. You could find the tutorial here, https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/wiki/MCscan-(Python-version).

Briefly, what I did is the following:

1) with the gene annotation gff file, make a bed file to indicate gene position

python -m jcvi.formats.gff bed --type=mRNA --key=ID --primary_only rabiosa.gff -o rabiosa.bed

python -m jcvi.formats.gff bed --type=mRNA --key=ID --primary_only barley.gff -o barley.bed

2) with the cds.fasta derived from our genome annotatioin, make a cds file required by mcscanx. This cds file actually is the cds.fasta, but I guess the purpose here is to verify the format  

python -m jcvi.formats.fasta format rabiosa_cds.fa rabiosa.cds

python -m jcvi.formats.fasta format barley_cds.fa barley.cds

3) run the mcscanx program

python -m jcvi.compara.catalog ortholog rabiosa barley --no_strip_names
